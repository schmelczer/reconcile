`EditedText` (at least in the Rust library) exposes an implementation of OT. The primary purpose of this library isn't to implement OT but to provide automated text merging, howver, OT happens to provide an easy way of merging the output of Myers' diff. The same result could be achieved through many CRDT implementations as well. However, the merging quality is only as good as the 2-way diffs are. For instance, `reconcile` doesn't support `move` operations the best as these are decomposed into an `insert` and `delete` operation by Myers'.
